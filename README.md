# 📘 Reading Companion

The **Reading Companion** is a tool designed to make research articles, journals, and technical texts easier to understand. Whether you're a student, curious learner, or just tired of fake news, this app helps you break through the jargon.

## ✨ Features
- **Simplify Technical Text**: Rewrite academic or technical content into plain English, perfect for readers of all levels.  
- **Key Definitions**: Extract and explain important terms and jargon.  
- **Questions & Answers**: Generate follow-up questions and answers to test understanding.  
- **Summaries of Long Texts**: Break down long, hard-to-read documents into digestible parts, then provide a concise overall summary.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The app is powered by **ChatGPT** but with extra processing steps to ensure accuracy and readability:

1. **Text Extraction from URLs**  
   Many research papers live behind complex websites. ChatGPT alone isn’t always able to open or interpret these links correctly.  
   That’s why we first **extract the raw text content from the page** (using tools like BeautifulSoup and custom scrapers). This ensures that only the relevant article body is passed forward, without ads, navigation bars, or cookie banners.  

2. **Chunking for Large Documents**  
   ChatGPT has a *context window* — a limit to how many tokens (words + characters) it can process at once.  
   Research papers often exceed this limit, so instead of cutting text off, we **split the document into chunks** at natural sentence boundaries. Each chunk is simplified individually.  
   Finally, we produce an **overall summary** from the simplified chunks, ensuring that key details aren’t lost.

3. **Better Accuracy**  
   By combining **text extraction** and **chunking**, the Reading Companion delivers more reliable and detailed simplifications than sending a raw link or giant block of text directly to ChatGPT.
