example_text = """Endometriosis is a medical condition wherein tissue resembling the lining 
             of the uterus, known as endometrial tissue, is located outside the uterus. 
             This condition leads to pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility,
             and it affects the quality of life for women. The prevalence peak for
             endometriosis is between 25 and 35 years old, which falls within the reproductive 
             age range. Environmental exposures and diet are among the risk factors associated 
             with this condition. Hormone therapies are commonly used as a first-line 
             treatment for certain conditions, but they are often not curative and can lead to
             additional side effects.
             Vitamin D has been identified for its potential in treating endometriotic lesions 
             because of its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Our research has 
             revealed that patients with endometriosis often have a deficiency in vitamin D. 
             Endometriosis shares some characteristics with cancer and may be associated with an 
             increased risk of autoimmune disorders. Vitamin D is suggested as a potential factor
             in this process due to its anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory 
             properties . Additionally, certain immune cells express VDR, as well as 
             vitamin D metabolizing enzymes such as 1-Î± hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase.
             Our studies have demonstrated a decrease in proliferation in peritoneal fluid mononuclear cells (PFMCs) 
             and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with endometriosis after receiving vitamin D treatment.
             Furthermore, our research has shown the effects of vitamin D3 on adhesion, invasion, 
             infiltration, proliferation, cell death, cytokine production, and angiogenesis potential of
             eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells from women with endometriosis."""
